# Modelling-of-Chua's Circuit
The project makes use of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to design a  Chua’s circuit that  exhibits chaotic behaviour.
The circuit is analysed using Kirchhoff’s circuit laws.  The realistic Chua circuit equations and dimensionless Chua circuit equations 
are compared and validated by means of code and simulation using MATLAB and MULTISIM softwares.
